Dipoles Implementation in NEMOH
Base code is finalfix of Implementation of Higher Order Panel Methods
I kept and updated the original implementation details for reference.




Implementation of Higher Order Panel Methods
Base code is the finalfix of Code Acceleration of the Calculation of Influence Coefficients



Code Acceleration of the Calculation of Influence Coefficients of Nemoh
1.1.1
 	1- As confirmed in http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=842512&start=0 and also in the given paper: "The extension of these results to the
case of finite water depth is still an open challenge." this is not in scope for this challenge

	

1.1.2
	1. <<Change Log contains files from another challenge not from this one>> I think it is normal for a changelog to contains all changelog. I should not replace old content in changelog.
	  I should add the new ones. And from the Changelog it is clear what changes have been done for this contest


1.2.1 
	1-<<Why is this change needed in Cmakelist to add heap-array?>>  heap-array is needed for Intel ifort compiler. By default ifort used stack to store Array in Linux. If the array is too big it will
          surely lead to stack overflow. By using -heap-arrays 1024 we are indicating that array of size greater than 1024 should be declared in the heap


    2- << Please do not un-necessarily add new flags (-g) to the CMakeList >> I remove it for the realease build and I keep it by default and in debug build.
       -g is for debugging purpose and I think it is necessary for testing because it will reveal more memory/other problems if there are any.



2.2.9

	2- << No comments for changes done in  Compute_Green_Surface >> This file is not changed
	4- simpson.py is not modified in this contest



2.5.5
	<< The codebase contains files form another challenge related to Drift Forces implementation >> As we are in finalfix, this is a plus of the submission.
	It is the overall goal to combine the modification of the two challenges. So it does not make sense to remove it in finalfix.
	ChangeLog list modified files in this challenge.
