
This program can only be compiled by using the Intel Fortran Compiler ifort


1-  Windows

	a) Compiling
	
	   Start the Intel Visual Studio Shell (32 or 64 bits)
	   Type "ifort .\GMRES.f90 .\M_SOLVER.f90 .\gmresvsgauss.f90 /exe:gmresvsgauss.exe /Qmkl /heap-arrays"
	       " was used for clarity. All command-line options are required. Specifically If you don't use
	       /heap-arrays you will most likely receive a stack overflow
	       
	       
	       
	b)  Usage
	
	   Type ".\gmresvsgauss.exe"
	   " was used for clarity.  This will run gmres and gauss on one random 2000x2000 matrix and gives you the statistics
	   
	   Type ".\gmresvsgauss.exe n"
	   " was used for clarity. Replace n by an integer. It will run gmres and gauss on n different 2000x2000 matrix
	    and gives you the statistic
	    
	    
	    
	    
2-  Linux

   a) Compiling
	
	   Start a terminal where you can run ifort
	   Type "ifort ./GMRES.f90 ./M_SOLVER.f90 ./gmresvsgauss.f90 -o gmresvsgauss -mkl -heap-arrays"
	       " was used for clarity. All command-line options are required. Specifically If you don't use
	       -heap-arrays you will most likely receive a stack overflow
	       
	       
	       
	b)  Usage
	
	   Type "./gmresvsgauss"
	   " was used for clarity.  This will run gmres and gauss on one random 2000x2000 matrix and gives you the statistics
	   
	   Type "./gmresvsgauss n"
	   " was used for clarity. Replace n by an integer. It will run gmres and gauss on n different 2000x2000 matrix
	    and gives you the statistic
